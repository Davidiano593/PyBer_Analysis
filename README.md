# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to identify the relationship between the trips made in different types of cities such as: rural, urban and suburban cities: the difference in rates, the number of trips, as well as the number of drivers to obtain accurate data on the greater number of trips made, and the average fares.

## Results

Based on the code we built we were able to get the following data

The majority of drivers are found in urban cities and the least amount in rural cities, this is because a greater number of people live in urban cities, therefore there are more trips and more drivers are required, compared to rural cities. ne where there are fewer drivers since the demand is lower, therefore the average rates are higher in rural cities; This is the typical example of offer-demand; drivers are scarce in rural cities, so the rates are higher.

Based on the rates by dates, I was also able to realize that the day that the most money was collected was a weekend day, exactly on February 24, 2019, where much more was collected compared to weekdays, so I could conclude that the weekends there are more trips.

## Summary:

My recommendation to the CEO of the company is to lower rates in rural cities, then people will use the service more and therefore the demand for drivers will increase, also, in rural cities there are more drivers than trips: Therefore, it has to limit the number of drivers since there are many drivers and fewer trips, the business is not viable for the drivers.
